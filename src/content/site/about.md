## What is The Programmers Hangout?

The Programmer's Hangout (TPH) is a discord community geared towards programming. The use of the word "geared" here is important because more accurately it's a discord for programmers of all kinds. If you're a green noob with 5 lines of code under your belt, or if you're a veteran with 15 years of industry experience, TPH has a place for you. More than that, there are over 90,000 people here. You can guarantee you won't be the only person with your experience level on the server.

## How do I join?

All you need to do is click. You'll be prompted to create yourself a Discord account if you don't already have one. We recommend setting one up, then reading the #rules-and-info channel.
