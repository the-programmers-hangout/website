## Intro

Welcome to the TPH first guided project!
The goal of this event is to help guide you through the steps of building a self contained project.

Any questions about the project, goals, or queries can be handled in the event channel.

You can use any language that the server currently has a channel for.

This project will expect you to have basic understanding of the language you are using and have a few extra tools
installed like; `git`, `netcat` (linux), `putty` (windows)

This project will guide you in the direction of what you need to do but it leaves individual learning up to you.
Feel free to ask for help, search topics online, look for tutorials for any of the concepts presented.

The idea is to guide you along but not give you all the answers. There will be pseudo code in some of the chapters in
this project it's down to you to achieve the functionality in your language of choice.
The pseudo code isn't representative of a final project and is there to convey specific ideas you need to achieve

## Rules

- Put in the work yourself. Don't copy and paste, the only person you are cheating is yourself.
- If you are helping don't spoon-feed. It's about the journey not the destination.
