## Chapter 9: Documentation and clean code.

Wew this is the chapter nobody wants to talk about.

A good project is one that is readable and understandable. To be readable code should have some sort of consistency
and formatting, this helps with navigation and generally makes working on the code easier. The second is understandable,
this comes in two flavours, concise code with clear meaning and documented code with clear explanation.

Most languages offer some sort of docstring processing, or have support for external tools like doxygen.

You should take advantage of this and document your code so far, try to explain and design choices and tell the reader
what each method does BUT do not go over the top. Nobody wants 500 lines of documentation explaining that `x = 1`.

## Goals

- Document and comment your code

## Bonus goals

- Write a readme.md in your repo
