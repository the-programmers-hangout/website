## Getting setup.

One of the first steps to any project is having a nice clear workspace to get started.
We can do the same with programming projects by creating an empty directory for our project to be developed in.

You should pick a suitable name for this project, you
can pick a word or phrase yourself or use a [project name generator](http://codenames.herokuapp.com/).
Try to make sure that there is no space in your project name as this will cause issues later.

If you are using a build tool that sets up the environment for you now would be a good time to run it.

Feel free to add the Hello World of your language to test that everything is setup correctly.

One of the key steps in this project will be to track progress and changes as you develop.
For this we are going to be using `git`. If you do not know git,
don't worry there will be links to [tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)
and [guides](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

Setup the git repository and push it to a remote host like Github or Gitlab or BitBucket.

Consider adding a `.gitignore` file to stop from committing unimportant files.
Here is a [guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files)

## Goals

- Pick a name for this project.
- Create a new directory on your system.
- Create a Hello World.
- Initialize a git repository in this directory.
- Add any files you need.
- Push the repository to a public host.

## Bonus goals

- Create a `.gitignore` file and add that to the repository.
