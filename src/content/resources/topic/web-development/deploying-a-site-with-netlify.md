Netlify is an awesome service for all kind of web apps and wesbites! Here you will learn how to deploy a site and add HTTPS security to it for free!

## Getting started

First you will have to navigate to https://netlify.com then login with your prefered service.
Now, there are two ways to deploy a site.

1. From a Github repository
2. Just drag and drop the files.
   So if you got your site files or Github repository ready, let's get started!

## 1. Deploying site from a Github repository

Go ahead and click the big button saying "New site from Git".
Choose Github, then search for the repository holding your site's files, then click next and one more next in the "Build and deploy options"
(If you know what you are doing, then change stuff in there if required)

Now, if everything was done successful, your site should be up and running under a random generated Netlify name.

## 2. Deploying site with drag and drop

First you will have to navigate to https://netlify.com then login with your prefered service.
Now, almost at the bottom of the page there is a file drop section, now open your File Explorer and drag and drop the site files inside there, the site should be running under a random generated Netlify name.

## Changing domain

### This is not sponsored, but https://freenom.com can provide you free fast domains if you don't have one already

Now if you have your site running on Netlify, it's good also changing it's domain.
Go to Settings > Domain management and there should be an option add domain (I dont really remember what it says)
After adding your custom domain, you will have to setup the Netlify DNS on your site.
The process is very simple, just follow the instructions given by Netlify.

## Adding HTTPS

Now, who does not like secure websites.
In Settings > Domain management at the bottom of the page there is the "HTTPS" section.
If you have have done the process of setting up the Netlify DNS, then just click on "Verify DNS configuration"
and your site should have a HTTPS connection now.

## Congrats!

If you done all the steps and everything is working, congrats!
Netlify got so much more to offer tho.
They have a custom form system, custom login system and many more for free!
Hope you liked this tutorial, and have a great day!
